RPi Spider Drone v0
A spider-inspired biomimetic drone project using Raspberry Pi 5 with webcam-based vision system.
Overview
This project implements a ground-based autonomous robot inspired by spider locomotion, utilizing a Raspberry Pi 5 as the control system and a webcam for visual perception ("eyes").
Inspiration
This project was born from multiple sources:

The Cube Spiders: A ResCon supervisor who hung plastic spiders from fishing line in my cubicle, dangling from the ceiling. Their subtle movements and biomechanics sparked the idea of mimicking spider locomotion.
Palmer Luckey on Joe Rogan: The Oculus/Anduril founder's discussion of autonomous defense systems and innovative approaches to military technology inspired the application focus.
Stingray Biomimetic Drone: Existing military drones modeled after stingrays demonstrated the viability of nature-inspired autonomous systems. If aquatic creatures work, why not terrestrial ones?

The convergence of these inspirations led to the concept: a spider-inspired ground drone with edge ML capabilities for military/aerospace applications.
